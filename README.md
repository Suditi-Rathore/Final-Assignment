# Next.js Seasonal Holiday & Contact Page

This project is a two-page UI-focused application built using **Next.js**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The project uses **React Context API** for state management and follows a structured approach with **components** and **containers**.

## Technologies

- Next.js
- React (with Context API)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Why Use Context API for This Project

- **Lightweight Solution**: Ideal for the limited state management needs of a two-page application.
- **Ease of Implementation**: Quicker setup and development without the boilerplate of Redux.
- **Focused State Management**: Manages local UI states effectively, aligning with the project's emphasis on user interface components.


## Project Structure

- **Containers**: 
  - Two containers, one for each page (Seasonal Holiday and Contact).
  
- **Components**: Used to make the code shorter and more manageable, rather than reusable.
